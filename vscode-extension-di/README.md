# Generic purpose library for VSCode extensions
This library is meant to have a collection of extension utilities to ease development of
a VSCode extensions building atop of a `vscode-extension-core` and
[inversify](http://inversify.io/). Idea is not to make any sort of Spring DI clone but to
use `inversify` to make it easier to build extensions and provide some of a same ideas
from a Spring DI container system.
